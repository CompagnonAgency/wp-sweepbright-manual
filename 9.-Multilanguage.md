# Multilanguage

WP SweepBright PRO supports multilanguage out of the box. SweepBright currently supports three languages: Dutch, French and English.

Only a couple of fields within SweepBright need are translations such as the `title`, `description`, `price costs` and `legal mentions`.

All of the other returned data does not have translations as they are either booleans, numbers or fixed values.

### Translatable data

```php
get_field('estate')['title']['nl'];
// Returns the Dutch title of a property
```

```php
get_field('estate')['description']['nl'];
// Returns the Dutch description of a property
```

```php
get_field('price')['price_costs']['nl'];
// Returns the Dutch additional price costs of a property
```

```php
get_field('legal_mentions')['nl'];
// Returns the Dutch legal mentions of a property
```
