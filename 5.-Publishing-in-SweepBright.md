## 1. Publishing a property

When you publish a property in SweepBright, it will be automatically added to the website.

## 2. Updating a property

When you update a property in SweepBright, it will be automatically updated on the website.

## 3. Deleting a property

When you delete a property in SweepBright, it will be automatically removed from the website.

## 4. Caching

In order to increase performance for complex filtering, the plugin caches all of the properties into a flat file.
This file can be found in `/wp-content/plugins/wp-sweepbright/db/<website_name>/estates.cache`.

The cache is automatically updated whenever a new publication (add/update/remove) occurs.

If for some reason your website isn't updating the cache, you can manually remove the `estates.cache` file. On a next page visit, the cache will be rebuilt automatically.
