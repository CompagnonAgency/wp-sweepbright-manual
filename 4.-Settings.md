## 1. API credentials

**Client ID**

> SweepBright client ID

**Client Secret**

> SweepBright client secret

## 2. Display options

**Max results per page**

> The maximum results you want to display per page (e.g. the overview page with all of the properties).

This variable is automatically applied to the `list()` method:

```php
WP_SweepBright_Query::list([
  ...
]);
```

> Returns: array

**Most recent estates**

> This is useful for showing a limited list of recent properties (e.g. on the homepage).

```php
WP_SweepBright_Helpers::settings_form()['recent_total'];
```

> Returns: integer

Example:

```php
WP_SweepBright_Query::list([
  'recent' => WP_SweepBright_Helpers::settings_form()['max_per_page']
  ...
]);
```

> Returns: array

## 3. Google reCaptcha

You can create Google reCaptcha credentials in the v3 Admin Console.

**Site key**

> reCaptcha site key

**Secret key**

> reCaptcha secret key

## 4. Custom URL

Set a custom permalink for your properties. When having the URL set to e.g. `/estates`,
the URL of a property would look like this in the browser: `https://an-estate-agency.com/estates/lakeview-mansion-cumbria`.

## 5. Default language

SweepBright supports multiple languages: english, french and dutch. This means that a property can have their title and description translated in those languages within SweepBright.

Setting the default language only affects the default language of the title being shown in the back-end of the plugin, otherwise this does not affect the language of the website in any way. So you're free to implement multilanguage functionality however you want.

## 6. SweepBright API version

To ensure maximum compatibility and performance we only support the most recent API version. But if you really have to, you can rollback to an older version of the SweepBright API. We do not recommend this however. It's best to leave this setting as is.
