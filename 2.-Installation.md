### Configuring the SweepBright API credentials

In order for proper testing to work, it's useful to fill in your SweepBright API credentials on beforehand.
You can do this on the "Settings" tab of the plugin (see screenshot).
Fill in SweepBright's `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

### Configuring Google reCaptcha

The plugin is shipped with built-in reCaptcha, which are used for the contact forms.
It's **important** to fill in these keys, in order for the built-in SweepBright contact forms to work.

## 5. Verifying your website

When you're ready to try out the SweepBright integration, let us know the name of your WordPress installation.
We will add it to our whitelist, so your plugin is licensed.

## 6. Final step: confirming the plugin's webhook to SweepBright

In order to publish properties from SweepBright to your website you need to send the plugin's webhook URL to SweepBright.
You can do this by sending an email with the URL below to SweepBright's technical team.

More information about this email can be found here:

**The plugin's webhook URL is using the following pattern:**

[https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/v1/sweepbright/hook](https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/v1/sweepbright/hook)

Replace **yourdomain.com** with your website's _(temporarily)_ URL.
