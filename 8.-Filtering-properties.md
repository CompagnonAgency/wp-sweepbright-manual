# Filtering properties

## How to get the search results?

You can filter properties by configuring the [WP_SweepBright_Query::list](6.-Retrieving-data.md#2-listing-properties) method.

# Example implementations

## 1. Plain PHP

You can render the search results server side by setting the `filter` and `sort` arguments from `list()` in PHP.
This is probably the easiest way, but it's a little less user friendly, since it requires a full page reload when applying a filter.

## 2. Javascript (recommended)

If you want to have a dynamic search filter that doesn't require a full page reload you can call the `list()` method from an API. You're free to decide on how to implement it.

The returned search results can be transformed to plain JSON object, so your JavaScript front-end can render it on the fly. This allows for a smoother user experience.
