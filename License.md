### 1. Why do I need a yearly license?

SweepBright uses a [webhook](https://website.sweepbright.com/docs/#header-1.-publish-a-property-to-the-custom-website) for publishing properties to your website. The webhook on your website should be responsible for retrieving and storing all of the property's information whenever a publication occurs in SweepBright.

However, if you have a lot of publications scheduled at the same time it could take up a lot of processing resources. 
Potentially leading to unpredictable or unreliable behavior.

We've solved this by creating our own webhook server which acts as a "man in the middle" between SweepBright and your website.

Whenever a publication is scheduled in SweepBright it will first connect to our dedicated webhook server where it will first schedule your publication. Once scheduled, it will publish the properties back to your website, one at a time. This makes publishing more reliable, so you don't have to stress about the synchronization.
